Global CO2 Emissions Tracker by Sector
This project presents an interactive Global CO₂ Emissions Tracker built using Power BI. The dashboard analyzes country-wise CO₂ emissions across key sectors such as Energy, Transport, and Industry, using historical global emissions data. It highlights major emitting countries, sector-wise emission contributions, emission trends over time, and per-capita emission differences. The project aims to support data-driven understanding of climate change and provide insights useful for environmental analysis and policy discussions.
